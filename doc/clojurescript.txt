clojurescript is translated into javascript.
all properties of javascript are therefore inherited by clojurescript.

translation is into the language of the browser.
the browser only sees

clojurescript aside -- advanced

(defonce app-state (atom {:text "Hello world!"}))
this sets up app-state to be a reagent atom 

(:text @app-state)
this is a function to retrieve :text key from key-map
notice @ at symbol.
this enables reading the reagent atom called app-state

when we write to app-state using reset! or swap! we do not need to
use @ at symbol , if we do that would be in error.
(reset! app-state ...)
(swap! app-state ...)
